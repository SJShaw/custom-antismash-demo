# custom-antismash-demo
A demonstration of a custom analysis pipeline using antiSMASH as a library

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress.

Alternate branding can be used, but not all use cases/entry points for this have
been completed.
To handle icons and logos in the HTML output, see the README in the HTML module's
images directory.

It is recommended that any variant created with this demonstration should update:
- README with relevant information
- `config/default.cfg` with URLs to the various sites where the project and documentation will be hosted
- `pyproject.toml` with updated author information, project names, executable names, etc
