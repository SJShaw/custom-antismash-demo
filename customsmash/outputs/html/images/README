# Images

In this demo, all the non-branded images from antiSMASH are used by default.
Branded icons/logos should be created and placed in this directory, with
the naming scheme:
`<taxon>_<lower-case branding>_icon.svg`
and
`<taxon>_<lower-case branding>_logo.svg`


The logo file should contain the name of your custom variant
(e.g. CustomSMASH) for better visibility.
The icon file is used to represent the taxonomy, e.g. the bacterial cell
in normal antiSMASH results. This can be anything.

If not overridding all HTML generation to skip these files *and* they are
not desired, create small blank SVGs with the same names to avoid browsers
marking them as missing images.
